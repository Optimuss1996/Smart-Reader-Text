        Once upon a time, in a very very sunny meadow, lived a bee.
Not just any bee — a very busy bee. A very very busy bee.
This bee buzzed. It buzzed in the morning. It buzzed in the afternoon.
It buzzed when the sun was up. It buzzed when the sun was down.
Buzz buzz buzz — that’s all the bee did. Buzz buzz buzz — all day long.
The bee had a mission. A very important mission. A very very important mission.
It had to visit flowers. Red flowers, blue flowers, yellow flowers, pink flowers.
It had to collect nectar. Sweet nectar. Sticky nectar. Very very sticky nectar.
Other bees watched. They watched and wondered.
“Why so busy, Busy Bee?” they asked.
The busy bee said, “Because I’m a busy bee. A very busy bee. A very very busy bee.”
The butterfly flew by. “Hello, Busy Bee,” said the butterfly.
“Want to play?”
“No time,” said the bee. “I’m busy. Very busy. Very very busy.”
The ladybug crawled up. “Hello, Busy Bee,” said the ladybug.
“Want to rest?”

“No rest,” said the bee. “I’m buzzing. Buzzing buzzing buzzing.”
The bee flew to the rose. Then to the tulip. Then to the daisy.
Buzz buzz buzz — flower to flower, hour to hour.
It didn’t stop. It didn’t slow. It didn’t nap. It didn’t yawn.
Even the wind said, “Slow down, Busy Bee.”
But the bee said, “No slowing. No stopping. No sleeping. I’m a busy bee. A very busy bee. A very very busy bee.”
One afternoon, the bee flew past a group of ants playing soccer.
They kicked the ball. They cheered. They laughed.
But the bee didn’t stop. It buzzed right by. Buzz buzz buzz.
Then one day, the bee buzzed into a big, big sunflower.
It was soft. It was warm. It was cozy. Very very cozy.
The bee sat. The bee sighed. The bee smiled.
And for the first time, the bee didn’t buzz.
It didn’t fly. It didn’t collect.
It just rested. Just a little. Just a tiny bit.

Then it buzzed again. Buzz buzz buzz.
Because it was a bee. A busy bee. A very busy bee. A very very busy bee.
And somewhere nearby, the ants were still playing soccer.
